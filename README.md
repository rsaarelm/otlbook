# otlbook

Personal information management system built on top of
[VimOutliner](https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner) files.

Work in progress. No guarantees it won't eat your data if you try it.

Imagine you wanted something like [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), but aren't
using Emacs. And maybe you don't really even need an editor mode, you can just
start writing text files using some special notation you know can be parsed
when you get around to writing a program for it. Otlbook is the program for it.

* Powered by [IDM](https://github.com/rsaarelm/idm)
* Proper documentation coming one day. Maybe.
* Keep your notebook directory versioned with git and then manually inspect
  the changes otlbook makes to see if everything is okay to prevent data loss
  and corruption.
